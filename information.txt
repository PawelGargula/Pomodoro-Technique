Rules:
 "Decide on the task to be done.

 Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).

 Work on the task.

 End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.

 If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.

 After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1."
